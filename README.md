## âš¡ Important Notice

To run this project and use the Swiggy API successfully, you need to get temporary access to the demo CORS proxy server.

1. Visit this link: <a href="https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo" target="_blank">https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo</a>
2. Click the **"Request temporary access"** button.
3. Once access is granted, you can run the project, and the API calls will work as expected.

> ðŸ”” This step is necessary because the Swiggy API does not support CORS by default.
